OpenPhillyGlobe
===============

"Google Earth for Philadelphia" with open source and open transit data.

**Live demo:** http://www.openphillyglobe.org/

In the short-term, we are visualizing [SEPTA routes](http://www3.septa.org/hackathon/) and [pedestrian counts](http://philadelphiaretail.com/demographics-ped-count.aspx).  We plan to include other transit layers such as [red light cameras](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/ppa-data) and [bike theft](https://github.com/CityOfPhiladelphia/phl-open-geodata).

There is a great open-data movement in Philadelphia, but there is not a one-stop viewer for the heterogeneous datasets.  OpenPhillyGlobe is an open-source web-based 3D globe for visualizing Philly's open data with an initial focus on simultaneously visualizing multiple transit layers.

OpenPhillyGlobe is built on [Cesium](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium), an open-source virtual globe engine, and developed in JavaScript.  It runs in a browser without a plugin.

OpenPhillyGlobe is developed for the [Apps for Philly Transit 2013](http://appsforphilly.org/?tag=transit) by [@abwood](https://twitter.com/abwood) and [@pjcozzi](https://twitter.com/pjcozzi) with special thanks to [@matt_amato](https://twitter.com/matt_amato).
